# Tic-Tac-Toe-3x3x3x3
Tic Tac Toe 3x3x3x3 game for Windows. Developed in C++.

It's like the classic Tic tac toe game but it's multiplied by 9 and a lot funnier.

It requires the basic configuration for <graphics.h> to compile.

- Controls: Arrow keys to move and space key to select.


Made for the Computer programming class in Universidad de Sonora.

El juego está escrito en español.
